# Zenith Copilot Frontend Tests and CI Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for comprehensive testing and CI/CD setup for the copilot-frontend Next.js TypeScript application.

## Testing Requirements

### Component Testing (Jest + React Testing Library)
- Unit tests for UI components in `/web/components/ui/`
  - Button, Card, Input, Label, Select, Switch, Table components
  - Badge, Sonner (toast) components
- Component tests for product-related components in `/web/components/products/`
  - Data table columns configuration
  - Product data table component

### Integration Testing
- Page-level integration tests for key application pages:
  - Home page (`/web/app/page.tsx`)
  - Products listing page (`/web/app/products/`)
  - Individual product page (`/web/app/products/[id]/`)
  - Inventory page (`/web/app/inventory/`)
  - Sync page (`/web/app/sync/`)

### API Route Testing
- Test API endpoints:
  - Products CRUD operations (`/web/app/api/products/`)
  - Inventory management (`/web/app/api/inventory/`)
  - Categories management (`/web/app/api/categories/`)
  - Sync operations (`/web/app/api/products/sync/`)

## CI/CD Requirements

### GitHub Actions Workflow
- Automated testing on pull requests and main branch pushes
- Pipeline stages:
  1. **Lint**: ESLint code quality checks
  2. **Test**: Jest unit and integration test execution
  3. **Build**: Next.js production build verification
  4. **Type Check**: TypeScript compilation verification

### Test Coverage
- Minimum 80% code coverage for components
- Integration test coverage for critical user flows
- API endpoint test coverage

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Testing Infrastructure Setup
1. Install testing dependencies (Jest, React Testing Library, @testing-library/jest-dom)
2. Configure Jest with Next.js integration
3. Set up test environment and utilities
4. Create test script commands in package.json

### Phase 2: Component Testing
1. Create test files for UI components
2. Test component rendering, props handling, and user interactions
3. Mock external dependencies (Supabase, React Query)

### Phase 3: Integration Testing  
1. Create page-level integration tests
2. Test user workflows and data fetching
3. Mock API responses for consistent testing

### Phase 4: CI/CD Setup
1. Create GitHub Actions workflow file
2. Configure automated testing pipeline
3. Set up build and deployment verification

### Phase 5: Documentation
1. Update README.md with testing instructions
2. Document CI/CD process
3. Add contribution guidelines for testing

## Technology Stack
- **Testing Framework**: Jest
- **Component Testing**: React Testing Library
- **Mocking**: Jest mocks for Supabase and external APIs
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Code Coverage**: Jest coverage reports

## Success Criteria
- All tests pass consistently
- CI pipeline runs successfully on all PRs
- Code coverage meets minimum thresholds
- Documentation is comprehensive and up-to-date
- Developer experience is streamlined for testing
